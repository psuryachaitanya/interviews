// Question 3 : Take a list / array of objects with each object having the following information:
//              - from - string of city
//              - to - string of city
//              - value - number representing say distance, number of rides, or cost of a trip
// There are no object values that map from -> to same city, i.e., see distance variable

// Transform it into 2D-array/matrix where each cell is the distance value.
//    - identify dimensions because from and to list has at most n-1 items and we need n dimensions
//      - because no SF -> SF.  the missing dimension values can be gotten from the 'to' field
//    - create the nxn array, initialize it, and put the value into it
